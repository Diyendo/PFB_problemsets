My Mama by Shel Silverstein



My Mama loves me,

My Mama cares,

My Mama picks me peaches and pears.

My Mama offers me candy and Cokes,

My Mama listens and laughs at me jokes.

My Mama helps when I get in a fight,

My Mama does all my homework at night.

My Mama misses me,

My Mama cries,

My Mama thinks I'm a wonderful guy.

So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,

I'll stand up and tell you that My Mama is.

But yesterday night I got quite a scare,

I woke up and My Mama just wasn't there.

I called out and reached out for My Mama's hand,

In the darkness where My Mama usually stands.

Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,

But I found somebody each place that I looked.

I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,

There's no doubt about it-

My Mama's gone!
